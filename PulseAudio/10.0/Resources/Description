[Name] PulseAudio
[Summary] PulseAudio is a sound server for POSIX and Win32 systems.
[Description] PulseAudio is a sound server for POSIX and Win32 systems. 
A sound server is basically a proxy for your sound applications. It 
allows you to do advanced operations on your sound data as it passes 
between your application and your hardware. Things like transferring 
the audio to a different machine, changing the sample format or channel 
count and mixing several sounds into one are easily achieved using a 
sound server.

PulseAudio has been tested on Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, Windows 2000 
and Windows XP. It should also run on all other POSIX and Windows 
systems, but may require new backends to handle their sound systems.
