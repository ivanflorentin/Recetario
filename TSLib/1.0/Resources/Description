[Name] TSLib
[Summary] Provides touchscreen interface in user space
[Description] Tslib is an abstraction layer for touchscreen panel
events, as well as a filter stack for the manipulation of those
events. It was created by Russell King, of arm.linux.org.uk. Examples
of implemented filters include jitter smoothing and the calibration
transform. 
Tslib is generally used on embedded devices to provide a common user
space interface to touchscreen functionality. It is supported by
Kdrive (aka TinyX) and OPIE as well as being used on a number of
commercial Linux devices including the Nokia 770.
